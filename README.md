# ANOVA-statistical-technique

ANOVA is a parametric statistical technique that helps in finding out if there is a significant difference between the mean of three or more groups.

### We can use this only when: 

the samples have a normal distribution.
the samples are selected at random and should be independent of one another.
all groups have equal standard deviations.


Null and Alternative hypothesis. 

H0 -> μ1 = μ2 = μ3 (where μ = mean)
Ha -> At least one difference among the means.
